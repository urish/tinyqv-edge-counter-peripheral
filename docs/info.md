## How it works

Edge counter peripheral for TinyQV that counts the number of edges on the `edge_detect` (ui_in[0]) pin.

## How to test

The edge counter is a peripheral for TinyQV that counts the number of edges on the `edge_detect` pin.

It has four 8-bit registers:

| Address | Name  | Access | Description                                                         |
|---------|-------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00    | RESET | W      | Resets the counter to 0                                             |
| 0x01    | INC   | W      | Increments the counter by 1                                         |
| 0x02    | VALUE | R/W    | Reads the current value of the counter                              |
| 0x03    | CFG   | R/W    | Edge detection configuration: 0 = disabled, 1 = rising, 2 = falling |

The lower 4 bits of the counter are displayed on the 7-segment display. The DP is lit when the counter is greater than 0x0F.

## Prompt

The peripheral was created by ChatGPT o3 using the following prompt:

```
Adapt this to an edge counter peripheral:

It has four registers, with the following functions:
1. Write to resets the counter
2. Write to increments the counter
3. Reads/writes the current value.
4. Configures edge counting: 0 - no counting, 1 - ui_in[0] rising edges, 2 - ui_in[0] falling edges

Counter is 8 bits.

The counter low nibble is displayed as HEX value on ui_out on 7-segment, using the following mapping:

segment uo_out[0] is segment A .. uo_out[6] is segment G, uo_out[7] is DP.

If the counter > 15, then DP goes high.
```

The prompt was followed by the sample peripheral code from the [TinyQV project sources](https://github.com/MichaelBell/tt10-tinyQV/blob/tt11/src/peri_simple_example.v).
